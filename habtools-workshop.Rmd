# Step 1: Capturing a 3D surface

### Project set-up

- Open RStudio.
- `File` > `New Project...`.
- Select `Version Control` and then `Git`.
- Copy `https://github.com/jmadinlab/habtools-workshop` and paste into the `Repository URL` field. Press tab and the `Project directory name` should auto-fill. 
- Select `Browse...` and choose where you want to store the project on your computer. Then click `OK`.
- In the bottom-right pane, click `Folder` to create a new folder and call is `sfm`.
- Click on the `sfm` folder in the file list, and create another folder called `images`. This is where you will store the images you take in the field.

### Gear list

- Camera, charged.
- Three scale markers (6 targets).
- A compass (often found in phones).
- GPS (often found in phones).
- Depth gauge for depths at markers.
- Transect tape for measuring between scale markers.
- Slate for notes (e.g., GPS, depths).

### Fieldwork

- Find a natural surface you want to model.
- Place the three sets of targets in an L shape; ideally at the same vertical height. Measure distances between one target on each set.
- Image the surface as instructed. You want at least 150 images.
- Record GPS coordinates above one target.
- Pick everything up.

### Metashape

- Export photos from camera into a folder named `habtools-workshop/sfm/images/` on your computer.
- Open `MetashapePro`.
- From the `Workflow` menu, select `Add Photos` and select all the photos in the `habtools-workshop/sfm/images/` folder.

###### Align photos

- From the `Workflow` menu, select `Align Photos` and ensure the selections reflect the following screenshot, then click `OK`:

<img src="figs/align-photos.png" width="400">

- Following alignment, which can take a while if you have lots of photographs, you can view what's called the sparse point cloud. 

###### Referencing & scaling

- Next you detect markers using `Tools` -> `Markers` -> `Detect Markers...`. Click `OK`. 
- Go to `Reference` panel.
- Open `Reference` settings (wrench and hammer symbol at the top-right of reference pane)
- Choose `Local Coordinates (m)` coordinate system (note that you can also create geo-referenced surfaces if you take a GPS coordinate for your surface).
- Highlight target pairs from scale bars (using crtl/cmd key), right-click `Create Scale Bar`.
- Enter scale distances in reference pane below the target pane (e.g., 0.08 m for 8 cm).
- Click the double-arrow symbol at top of reference pane. 

###### Build model

- From the `Workflow` menu, select `Build Model` and ensure the selections reflect the following screenshot, then click `OK`:

<img src="figs/build-model.png" width="400">

- Following building, which can take a while if you have lots of photographs, you can view the model. 
- From the `Workflow` menu, select `Build Point Cloud` and ensure the selections reflect the following screenshot, then click `OK`:

<img src="figs/point-cloud.png" width="400">

- Following building, you can view what's called the dense cloud. 
- Use the `Workflow` menu to build a DEM and a orthomosaic.
- Export the DEM and orthomosaic into a folder called `habtools-workshop/data`.

# Step 2: Estimating complexity metrics

- Go to RStudio and open `habtools-workshop.Rmd`.
- If RStudio is closed, go the the `habtools-workshop` folder on your computer and double-click the `habtools-workshop.Rproj` file. 

1. Load and plot the DEM

```{r}
dem <- raster("data/dem.tif")

```

2. Crop the DEM and calculate some metrics

```{r}

# Crop DEM

# Surface area

# Rugosity

# Height range

# Fractal dimension

# DEM split

# Metrics for dem list

# Plot RDH

# Sample DEM

```

- Re-project DEM (if you have a GPS coordinate)

```{r}

# Change to your lat, lon values
lat <- 43.020704
lon <- 144.836736

sr <- paste0("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=", lat, " +lon_0=", lon, " +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
crs(dem) <- sr

writeRaster(dem, filename="data/dem-crs.tif", overwrite=TRUE)

```

4. Load orthomosaic & re-project

```{r}

ort <- stack("data/ortho.tif")
plotRGB(ort)
points(0, 0, col="red", pch=3)
rect(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5)

crs(ort) <- sr
writeRaster(ort, filename="data/ortho-crs.tif", overwrite=TRUE)

```

# Step 3: Exploring biodiversity relationships

Open ArcGIS or QGIS and load the re-projected DEM and orthomosaic.  You can print your orthomosaic on underwater paper and annotate plants and animals. You can add these annotations in GIS so you have a spatial map of your study taxa. In QGIS:

- `Layer` -> `Create Layer...` -> `New Shapefile Layer...`
- File name. Click little dotted box. Select `habtools-workshop/data` folder. Write `annotations`
- Geometry type. Select `Point` (you can also create polygons to outline areas)
- Add a new field called `species`
- Click `OK`
- Double-clock the `annotations` layer in the left-hand panel. Select `Labels`. At top choose `Single labels` and select species as the `Value`. Also, select `Draw text buffer` lower down in the menu.  Click `OK`.
- Click the pencil icon (Toggle Editing). 
- Click the `Add Point Feature` icon (three dots and a star-like thing)
- Click on the surface to annotate, and enter your species names. 
- Don't forget to save (little disk icon)

- Open annotations

```{r}

ann <- read_sf("data/annotations.shp")
ann <- st_transform(ann, crs=sr) # applying the same coordinate system as the DEM

# Load DEM with coordinate system and plot annotations

```

- Crop surface around annotations.

```{r}

# Use dem_crop to capture surface around each annotation

# Calculate complexity metrics in vicinity of annotations.

# bind the species column to the data.frame

```

- Explore the data with plots

```{r}

# Scatterplot

# Boxplot 

```
