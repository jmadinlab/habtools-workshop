# The *habtools* workshop

This workshop is a one-day introduction to creating a 3D model of a
natural surface and analyzing it using the
*[habtools](https://jmadinlab.github.io/habtools/)* R package. The
workshop has two parts:

1.  Capturing a 3D surface
2.  Estimating surface metrics

The workshop instructions can be found [here](habtools-workshop.md).

# Preparation

You will need a laptop with wireless connectivity. You will need space
on your hard drive; at least 2GB (approximately “one movie”-worth of
space). If you already use any of the software listed below, please
update it before the course so that we are all using the same versions.

### Metashape

  Professional Educational
  Edition](https://www.agisoftmetashape.com/product/agisoft-metashape-professional-educational-edition/)

### R and RStudio

- Install R first: <https://cran.r-project.org>
- After R is installed, install RStudio:
  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download>
- Open RStudio and install the following packages (menu `Tools` \>
  `Install packages...`):
  - `ggplot2`  
  - `dplyr`  
  - `raster`

> If you are new to R and Rstudio, you can familiarize yourself with
> some basics by following a beginner introduction
> (e.g. <https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/>
> or <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro>).

### Optional

If you would like to visualize the digital elevation model (DEM) and
orthomosic you create, you can use ArcGIS or QGIS, the latter of which
is free.
